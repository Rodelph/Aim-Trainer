# SFML-Game-Dev

This is an aim trainer where you have to hit all the circles in order to stay alive and gain as many points as possible !!
If you miss hitting one of them, you will then lose an amout of hp based on the size of the circle. The smaller the circle the bigger the penality will be,
the bigger the circle the smaller the penality will be. 
As for when u hit a circle you gain points, and some hp back based on the radius of the circle (the smaller the bigger hp recovery will be).
